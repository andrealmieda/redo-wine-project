# Button

This component is a styled version of the `button` component from react. It doesn't change any of the original props.
This component supports 3 different flavors. 

- Default
- Primary
- Secondary

To use the flavors just pass the props `primary` or `secondary` accordingly to `<Button />`. 
The default flavor is active unless one of the other flavors props is passed  

## Visual look
Here is the look of the flavors `primary`, `secondary` and default respectively.
<Playground>
    <Button primary> Hello I'm the Primary </Button>
    <Button secondary> Secondary here! </Button>
    <Button> I'm the default one </Button>
</Playground>
